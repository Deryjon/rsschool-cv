## Summary
Specializing in working with Vue 3 and Nuxt frameworks, I have significant experience with Vuetify, UI Kit, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Nuxt UI, and Iconify libraries. Additionally, I am well-versed in Sass, Less, and Bootstrap for styling. I confidently use Git and GitHub, including branch management and team collaboration.

I handle HTTP requests using Axios and am skilled in writing both Composition API and Options API in Vue. Furthermore, I have experience with TypeScript and Pinia for state management, implementing JWT for authentication, integrating Swagger for API documentation, and using DatePicker for date management in applications.
